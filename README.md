# 🚀 OmerOps – DevSecOps Portfolio

A unified portfolio of production-ready implementations by **Omer Mohammed**. This repository showcases real-world applications of DevSecOps principles: shifting security left, automating infrastructure, and optimizing containerized environments.

## ⭐ Featured: Production-Grade Multi-Container System
**Location:** [`/Multi-Container-Docker`](./Multi-Container-Docker)

This is a deep-dive into high-availability container orchestration. It moves beyond basic tutorials to address real-world production concerns:

* **Security-First Builds:** Multi-stage Dockerfiles reducing attack surface by 65%.
* **Vulnerability Management:** Automated **Trivy** scanning and **Gitleaks** secret detection.
* **Runtime Hardening:** Implementation of non-root users, health checks, and resource limits.
* **CI/CD Integration:** Automated deployment workflows to AWS EC2 via GitHub Actions.

## 🛡️ Security Implementation
Every project in this repository follows a **Security-by-Design** approach:
1.  **Secret Management:** No hardcoded secrets; validated via Gitleaks.
2.  **Image Scanning:** All images are scanned for CVEs before deployment.
3.  **Least Privilege:** IAM roles and container users are restricted to the minimum permissions required.
